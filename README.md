# Markdown and HTML repository

This sample project intend to illustrate how can we maintain two versions of a single project.

- Markdown version : which can be useful for markdown fans (via Github)
- HTML version: for anyone else who wants an HTML copy of your ideas (webpage)

> For the purpose of filling this project with sample data, we will share pictures and posts related to minimalism culture.
